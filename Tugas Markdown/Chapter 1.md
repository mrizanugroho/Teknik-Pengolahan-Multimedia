# **Introduction**

*It was a dark and stormy night.*

A storyteller might use these portentous words to capture your
attention and draw you into a tale. A novelist might use the same
words to begin the first page of a book. A radio play based on the
same story could open with a crash of thunder and the howling of
the wind. A film of the book could open on a scene of darkness,
suddenly illuminated by a flash of lightning that reveals trees bent
over in the gale

The dark and stormy night can be represented in different *media*,
each of which tells the story through different means, appealing to
different senses. One of the key insights in computing is that all
these media can be represented *digitally*, as a structured collection
of bits, and can then be manipulated by programs on a computer,
stored on disks and other storage devices, and transmitted over
networks. Their shared digital representation means that different
media can be combined into what is loosely called *multimedia*

The combination of different media is not something new. On
the contrary, established forms mix media routinely. A TV news
bulletin, for example, might include sound and moving pictures
— both live and recorded — still images, such as photographs of
politicians, graphic illustrations, such as a histogram showing the
trend in unemployment, and text, in the form of subtitles, captions, quotations, and credits, which will usually be accompanied

by suitable annunciatory music. A contemporary live theatrical
performance may incorporate two- or three-dimensional artwork
and design (sets, backdrops, costumes), sound, which may be a
mixture of speech and live music, perhaps with tape recordings
and synthesized sounds, projected still and moving images, and
sometimes text in the form of surtitles (written text displayed above
the stage, which are often used for translation, especially in opera).
The integration of media is natural — we perceive the world through
all the senses we have at once; the separation of media is artificial,
and may often seem unsatisfactory.

Consider film, for example. From the earliest days of cinema,
in the absence of any method of recording and playing sound in
synchronization with picture, separate live sounds were produced
at the same time as the film was shown: not just the live piano
accompaniment that you may find in contemporary art-house
cinema showings of silent classics, but dialogue, singing, and sound
effects, produced by actors, singers, and noisemakers in the theatre,
often hidden behind the screen. So great was the film-going public's
desire to hear sound naturally integrated with moving pictures that
in 1927 when Al Jolson spoke his phrase, 'Wait a minute, wait a
minute. You ain't heard nothing yet,' in The Jazz Singer, audiences
stood up and cheered. It is hardly surprising, then, that once the
technical obstacles to representing media digitally (which we will
consider in Chapter 2) were overcome, the next step should be to
combine separate media. In fact, the separation of digital media into
distinct data types — different 'sorts of things' to which different
operations can be applied — can be seen as a temporary exigency
demanded by an immature technology.

# **Applications of Multimedia**

What is it, then, if not the combination of media, that distinguishes
digital multimedia from previous forms of combined media? It is
the fact that the bits that represent text, sound, pictures, and so on
can be treated as data by computer programs. The full potential
of this fact has not yet been fully explored, but one facet of it
immediately distinguishes digital multimedia from its predecessors.
A program can control the order in which various components
are presented and combined, and can do so in response to input

from a computer user. In other words, digital multimedia can be
interactive, in a way that, for example, a TV news bulletin is not,
and that goes far beyond the simple control afforded by a VCR

The digital multimedia version of the story we began this book with
could open with a picture depicting a dark and stormy night. By
clicking on an icon on the screen, the user could cause the scene to
play as a video clip, or add sound effects, according to their choice.
Perhaps by clicking on different areas of the scene, details could be
revealed, or a new scene could be introduced — a different one for
each part of the first scene, allowing the tangled tale of betrayal and
redemption that began on that dark stormy night to unfold in more
than one way, told through the eyes of different characters. Users
whose hearing was poor could choose to have a transcription of any
dialogue displayed for them, while users with impaired vision could
have a description of what was happening 'read' to them by their
computer. Different interface options might be offered for users
with different tastes and needs. If the story had attracted critical
attention, it might be possible to bring up learned commentaries
on particular aspects, or a history of its telling in different media.
There might be an opportunity for the user to take an active role,
change the story, add new elements or recombine the existing ones.

Suppose, though, that this is not just a story — that some crime
was committed on a real dark and stormy night, and that somebody
had subsequently been arrested and charged with an offence. By
collating evidence from witnesses, and facts about the location,
the events of the night could be reconstructed and presented, like
our story, as a mixture of animation, graphics, sound and video,
with textual annotations. Members of the jury could then examine
the event from different angles, verify that it was possible to see
something at a certain distance, perhaps factor out the parts of
the reconstruction based on a certain witness's evidence, or try out
various hypotheses suggested by the lawyers in the case. Forensic
*multimedia* of this sort is already being used in courts in the United
States.

Digital multimedia may be used for many things besides stories and
forensic reconstructions. The most prominent and economically
significant uses of multimedia at present are in the fields of
entertainment and education. At one extreme, the combination
of sound, animation, video and text with interactivity is commonly
found both in adventure games, such as Starship Titanic and action
games, such as Doom and its bloody offspring. At the opposite

extreme are the multimedia reference works, such as the *Cinemania*
cinema encyclopedia, or the digital versions of the *Encyclopedia
Britannica*.

Multimedia is also being used educationally in schools, and for
extra-curricular and pre-school learning, where multimedia teaching
materials can be used to present information in more direct ways
than traditional books and lessons. For example, film clips and
original recordings of radio broadcasts can be integrated with a
textual account of events leading up to the Second World War
in a modern history lesson. Virtual science experiments can be
constructed using multimedia techniques, to allow pupils to work
with simulations of equipment that is not available to them. In both
these cases, interactive features allow pupils to work at their own
pace, or to pursue specialized aspects of a project according to their
particular interests. Multimedia teaching materials can be bought in
as complete CD-ROM titles, or they can be made by teachers in their
own schools. Children themselves can also make multimedia, in the
form of project reports, or as an end in itself, as an electronic class
book or newsletter.

The distinction between education and entertainment is not a clear
one; several succesful multimedia CD-ROMs use elements of games
for an educational purpose. For example, *The Logical Journey of
the Zoombinis* develops children's problem-solving skills through a
series of puzzles, organized in the form of a game. This approach to
learning seems to be popular for very young children, with a range
of titles available for teaching literacy and basic mathematics. These
are aimed both at schools and at parents, for use in the home. (As
a side-effect, the use of such materials also teaches computer skills
from an early age.)

In contrast to the entertainment and education sectors, where most
multimedia is professionally produced and marketed, much of the
material used in business is produced for a specific company, often
in-house. In a continuation of the use of multimedia in formal
education, multimedia materials are used for training. As with the
virtual science experiments in schools, multimedia can be used to
produce interactive simulations of equipment and procedures, in
cases where it would be expensive or hazardous to use the real thing
for training. Multimedia is also used in sales presentations and
promotions — for example, computers on sale in showrooms often
run multimedia presentations describing their capabilities, and Web
pages often function as sales brochures.

Some professions and business areas lend themselves especially
well to multimedia. Graphic designers produce interactive presentations of their work as a supplement to, or even as a substitute
for, a conventional portfolio. The electronic portfolio can be
inexpensively duplicated on CD-ROM and sent to potential clients,
or posted on a Web site as a virtual exhibition. In the shrinkwrapped software business, paper manuals have been gradually
giving way to electronic documentation for some years. The move
from hard copy to digital formats has provided an opportunity
to augment the text and diagrams of conventional manuals with
animations, video clips, and sound. Many programs now come with
a multimedia product tour, demonstrating their best features, and
interactive tutorials, which guide novice users through simple tasks.

One area in which computation plays a more active part is
visualization, in which graphics and animation are used as a means
of presenting complex data. Banal examples of visualizations
include pie-charts and bar-charts being generated from spreadsheet
data: their graphical form summarizes the data in a way that
makes recognition of trends and comparisons between magnitudes
possible at a glance. More complex data than the sort normally kept
in spreadsheets demands more complex visualizations to provide
the same degree of comprehensibility. Three-dimensional and timevarying presentations, making use of false colour to carry extra
information, are often favoured. Such elaborate visualizations
are frequently generated from simulations of complex dynamic
systems: for example, a program that simulates atmospheric
dynamics may generate a time-lapse movie of the gestation of a
tropical storm; a program simulating an organic chemical reaction
may generate a three-dimensional model of the structure of the
molecules involved, showing the changes they undergo. As these
examples show, visualization is widely used by scientists; it is also
used in business, where the systems being tracked or simulated are
financial, and the output is correspondingly more abstract.

The established entertainment industry, while still delivering an
essentially linear and non-interactive product, now makes extensive
use of digital multimedia technology in the production of everything
from blockbuster movies to gardening programmes on TV. The
use of connections with digitally delivered material, such as links
between programming and supporting Web sites, or accompanying
CD-ROMs for mainstream movies, is rapidly expanding. At the
same time, a rapidly increasing number of festivals, conferences and other international events are providing showcases for "new media"
at all levels from the artistic avant garde to the purely commercial.
